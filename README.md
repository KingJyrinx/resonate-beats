# resonate-beats ðŸŽµ
resonate-beats is a Discord COG file which can be integrated to any discord bot to add superb music streaming functionality to the existing bot.

## Setup
There is an extension file in COG directory named musiccog.py, add that file to your existing cog directory and the add "resonate_utils" directory to one level top of it. So if your current setup should look like this : 

```
â”œâ”€â”€ bot.py
â”œâ”€â”€ cogs
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ admin_cmds.py
|   |__ ...
â”‚Â Â  |__ musiccog.py     ----> Music Cog file.
|   |__ ...
|
â””â”€â”€ resonate_utils     ----> Utilities directory one level above from COG.
    â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ custom_exceptions.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ decorators.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ embeds.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ logger.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ music_utils.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ resonate_settings.py
    â””â”€â”€ track_utils.py
```
<b>NOTE : </b>The ```musiccog.py``` file contains relative imports from ```resonate_utils``` dir, If your project needs to change the location of resonate utiils then change the relative imports to absolute imports.

Once your directory setup is complete, load the cog/extension in your bot by the method you are using to load COGs in your bot.
The musiccog contains a built in logger so you will know it the file has been loaded successfully as it will print status to the STDOUT.
